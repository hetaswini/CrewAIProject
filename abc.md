## Judicial Separation in Divorce Law: A Comprehensive Overview

Judicial separation, also known as legal separation, is a legal process that allows married couples to formally separate while remaining legally married. It is distinct from divorce, which dissolves the marriage entirely. In many jurisdictions, judicial separation provides a legal framework for addressing issues such as property division, spousal support, and child custody, while allowing couples to explore reconciliation or simply live apart without the finality of divorce.
